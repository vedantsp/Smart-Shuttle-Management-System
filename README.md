# Smart Shuttle Management System

A real-time campus shuttle management solution built with Spring Boot, Angular, PostgreSQL, and AWS. Features live tracking, seat reservations, and ETA calculations (Haversine Algorithm) to ensure efficient transportation for students and staff.

---

## Motivation

Manually managing campus shuttle services often leads to delays, miscommunication, and underutilization. This system automates:

- Realâ€‘time GPS tracking  
- Optimized route planning  
- Seat reservations  
- ETA calculations  

to improve user experience and shuttle efficiency.

## Features

- **Live Tracking**: Drivers update their location; users see shuttles moving on a map.  
- **Seat Reservations**: Students and staff can book seats in advance.  
- **ETA Calculation**: Uses the Haversine Algorithm for accurate arrival estimates.  
- **Role-Based Access**:  
  - **Users**: Book seats and track shuttles.  
  - **Drivers**: Update location in real time.  
  - **Admins**: Manage routes, schedules, and users.
